Android Environment Tool

Setup
===
Just git clone to your home directory or the script will not work

cd /home/<your system name> OR cd ~/

THEN

./Start

Known bugs
===

When going to other menus via start script, pressing 00 returning back from launched script then trying to exit from start script... you will have to press "0" 3 times

i.e I use start script to go to 12 - tools. It enter tools and I press 00 - Exit to main AEI. Then I press 0 - Exit.. it won't exit, you have to enter 0 two more times then it will exit

Not a bug but purposely done
===

it lags a bit as i have reset terminal parameters in place to clear terminal when switching to menus
